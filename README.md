Whistle Island project

Whistle Island app is the first group project at Le Wagon Berlin.
The objective was to build from scratch an Airbnb like app. In this case we replaced flats by islands.

To build this app, we defined the following user stories:

- As an island renter, I can search for an island
- As an island renter, I can book an island (according to availabilities)
- As an island owner, I can add an island
- As an island owner, I can set a availabilities

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
